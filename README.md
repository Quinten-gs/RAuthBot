# RAuthBot
**R**eddit account **Auth**entication **Bot**.

## Technical Goals
The goal of this project is to create a reddit bot which posts an overview of heuristics on the authenticity of an account on user requests. This bot will not give a final answer on whether an account is a bot, it will merely condense account information to make users aware of this info to let them make their own decision on whether an account is a bot. 

The heuristics include, but are not limited to 
- Age of the account
- Comment and post heuristics towards certain topics such as e.g. 
  - Countries
  - Continents
  - Political figures
  - Controversial subjects
  - Commercial products 
  - ...
- User activity overview
  - Subreddit activity overview
  - Post and comment time analysis overview
  - ... 

## Aim of the Project
The aim is to provide a tool to reddit users to discern desinformation or commercial campaign bots from real users and at the same time to map the results from this bot for later analysis.
